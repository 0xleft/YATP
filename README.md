# Welcome to YATP!

#### DOWLOAD AT: https://github.com/0xleft/YATP/raw/main/dist/YATP.exe

This codebase is very messy and was made as a demo.

# Running
1st way: `run the main.exe` in `dist` folder if you want to run the compiled application

2nd way: `python main.py` if you want to run without compiled version

# Compiling

the .exe was compiled using the following command
```
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon "assets/maxresdefault-2512841701.ico" --add-data "./core;core/" "./main.py" -n YATP
```

this will not for you since you need to change the paths to your own

(a icon was added but it is unnecessary)
